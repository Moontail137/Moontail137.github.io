    <h1>Modern Animation Techniques</h1>

    <p>In the mid-90s Pixar began to take off with its feature length films, the first of which was "Toy Story". The animation studio had already shown great promise with its shorts and quickly became a pioneer in CGI animation. Earlier films struggled with animating hair and people, so movies like "Monster’s Inc." and "The Incredibles" were massive steps forward in terms of 3D animation. </p>

    <p>Up until recently, the goal with 3D animation had been to get it as realistic as possible, however once we hit that point, many studios began to wonder what was next.</p>

    <p>In 2018, a film called “Spider-man: Into The Spider-Verse” was released, sending shockwaves across the animation industry. This film took on an entirely new approach to animation, and combined elements of 3D as well as hand-drawn 2D animation to create an effect not unlike a living comic book. However, where “Spider-man: Into The Spider-Verse” was the first to popularize the technique of mixing 2D and 3D animation, it was not the first. </p>

    <p>An earlier example of this style was actually shown in “The Lego Movie”. In fact, the producers for “Spider-man: Into The Spider-Verse” had previously worked on “The Lego Movie”. </p>

    <p>All of this begs the question, what does the future of animation look like?</p>

    <p>It appears in recent years that many films have been taking inspiration from the animation style in “Spider-man: Into The Spider-Verse”, and companies such as DreamWorks have been adapting their entire animation style to mirror the change. Movies such as “The Wild Robot” and “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” are prime examples of a new wave of animation being born. AI is even being put into use in recent years, both “Spider-man: Into The Spider-Verse.” And “Spider-man: Across The Spider-Verse” used machine learning programs to help animate the ink-lines in the films. </p>

    <p>Whatever the case may be, the future of animation looks bright, and it seems many are eager to see what comes next from the industry as a whole.</p>
